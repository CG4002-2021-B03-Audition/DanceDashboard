# Dashboard
DanceParty was created as part of my final year capstone project - **a platform to help dancers learn how to dance better through the use of smart wearables.** 

I was in charge of building a dashboard to display the dance moves of dancers and provide them with real-time feedback. At the same time, dancers can also track their progress of previous sessions via the offline analytics tools that I provide.
